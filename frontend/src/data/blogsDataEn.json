I can't wait to get the first feedback, and I'm thrilled at the idea of people playing my game.",

                    "Firstly, the feedback is unanimous: the game is HARD! Extremely hard, if not impossible! Very good. We'll have to spend a lot of time on this part of the game.",
                    "Secondly, the game at that time was only playable on the keyboard. I had intended to create a controller adaptation, but this would be tedious to develop, so I didn't want to dwell on it for the time being. It was clear that I was going to have to take this time, as keyboard playability was very complicated.",
                    "On the difficulty front, I started by reducing monster damage. I then increased the player's hit points, boosted certain items, redesigned certain rooms, added a potion for healing in combat and a whole host of other small changes.",
                    "The biggest addition has been passive skills. When you kill monsters, you recover experience as well as money. Once back in the main HUB, we can spend our points to buy skills via a table. Increased damage or even life, more potions, armor and much more.",

                    "Then I tackled the rooms themselves. I wanted to have rooms filled with sets. In terms of budget, this was impossible. I had to limit myself. So I came up with the idea of decorating all the rooms with NPCs.",

Yes, there's a big Portal vibe! I'll let you play the game to discover all its subtleties.",
                    "To complete the game, a boss had to be created. I won't go into too much detail about this monster, as it's bound to leave a few surprises, but I guarantee you'll spend a lot of time there!",
                    "The final addition will be a gameplay mechanic. In the game, we spend our time attacking enemies. We do it without really knowing how. I thought having weapons, each with a unique power, would be nice and would add even more depth to the gameplay strategy. Weapons would have a normal and an epic mode, which would further increase the bonus they provide.",
